This demonstrates my issue with Snowpack which is not present in Rollup.

To set the examples up, `cd` into the `rollup` directory and run `npm i` followed by `npm start`, then do the same for the `snowpack` directory.

I included the same source code in each folder, and I kept the configurations for both Snowpack and Rollup as minimal as I could.
